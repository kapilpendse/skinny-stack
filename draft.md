# On Shoulders of Cloud Giants

Cloud is the new normal is already old news. Cloud adoption is increasing across every market segment, including enterprises. This pervasiveness of cloud is a double edged sword for software producers. On one side there are benefits like:

- Build a software as a service business with global audience
- Ability to scale infrastructure as quickly as business needs
- Low cost of onboarding new customers
- Faster time to market
